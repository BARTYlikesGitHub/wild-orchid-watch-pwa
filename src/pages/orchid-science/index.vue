          Wild Orchid Watch (WOW) is a national citizen science project designed
          for orchid data collection. An online platform incorporating an app,
          website and database enable researchers, native orchid enthusiasts and
          citizen scientists to upload and identify orchid observations. The WOW
          app will guide users to make a series of observations in the field,
          collecting information designed to be of maximum relevance to
          scientists, such as photographs, habitat details and location.

          Australia has the world's most diverse terrestrial orchid flora.
          However, our native orchids are highly susceptible to environmental
          change and account for 17% of nationally threatened plant species.
          Where orchids have survived outright destruction of their natural
          habitats, climate change, altered fire and grazing regimes, and
          pollination deficits contribute to population declines. Many questions
          about orchid taxonomy, ecology and conservation remain unanswered.
          Orchids are often cryptic, and differences in emergence with season
          combined with short flowering times make it difficult to obtain data
          using traditional methods.

          This program builds on the growing momentum for citizen science in
          Australia, harnessing the knowledge and expertise of orchid
          enthusiasts who are keen to get involved. Data collected by citizen
          scientists using the WOW app will add to historical records to allow
          researchers to understand the value of orchids as indicators of
          environmental change, as well as provide fundamental information on
          orchid distribution, abundance, and phenology (life cycle events;
          emergence, flowering, fruiting) and how they are changing. This new
          information is critical to better understanding the status and trend
          of orchids and assessing their conservation status.
